# record-org-contact

This is a dummy app to show the possibilities for analysts in our department to:

* keep a record of the research projects that have taken place
* keep a record of organisations that we have contacted in these projects
* explore data about organisations with whom we've had contact
* use this infomration to inform the design of future studies, including the sampling of organisations for contact
